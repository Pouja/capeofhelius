Long time since the last time I wrote a piece.
So where is the game now?
There are enemies, parallax background, you can die when hitting an enemy or spiky point or lava or water.
There are moving platforms.
There are non collidable dynamic scenery (like a torch, clouds etc).
There are collectables.

What has to happen?
Dialog system
Sword animation + hitting enemy with it
Key collecting, now you can only collect coins. But it should be possible to collect keys to unlock a new part.
Enemy AI. The current enemies just do a simple patrol.

The extra thing I did today was letting my roommate play.
The results were funny, first of all he enjoyed the game due the style and art (thx kenney!) and due the difficulty. Plus he enjoyed the different types of hurdles.
The only thing was that I noticed that he wanted to go back. But that was not possible due the design of the map. But it should be.
He also expected that you will not instantly die and respawn when hitting an enemy or spikes. But that you 'bounce' back and lose half a hearth. I agree with that, that is a way better way of handling death. Currently, it doesnt matter what you hit, if it can kills you, you will respawn. Which makes the game unpleasentable difficult. (Weird concept: unpleasentable difficult, but interesting).

So but the code needs a lot of cleaning up, I had to rush a lot because the game (first chapter) should be fully playable in 48 hours.
