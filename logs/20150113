Day 2: 20150113

So what did I do that you can see. Well I have started with the back story and some rant on how the story will look like.
As opposite what I said in day 1, I will start with writing the whole story to a level of that all dialogs will be know and what the character does. From there I will choose the appropriate map tile and character sprites, plus other sprite I guess.

What did I do that you can't see. Well, I majorly thought on if cocos2d-x is the right choose. I mean, for real projects that you do, you define the requirements and choose the tools that are necessary to fill those requirements. But in this case, I just wanted to have a project with cplusplus. I did so many things with JavaScript, Java, some other bullshit languages that I got tired of it. But then I though, I dont have much time and experience with making games and cplusplus. But then I though, yes I know I think too much, fuck it, I will do what I want, if it gets fucked up, that just means I have less sleep, it will be worth it, no I dont use l'oreal.

Other things I did, was searching the web for tile sets, what is there, how much will it cost, can I get some free stuff. Well the bottom line is, there is a high probability that I would have to pay for it. But it wont cost much, a lot of artists sell it for just 10$. There are free tile sets, but the quality of it are just meh, plus I dont think I will find tile sets that will match the story and the game.
