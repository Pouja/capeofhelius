current problem,
calculating collision on 8 points of a sprite.
1 2 3
4 C 5
6 7 8

if any point in the desiredPosition collides, move the sprite amount of units back in such a way that it barerly collids and set the velocity correctly.
For point 1,2,3,6,7,8 set velocity.y to zero.
For point 4 and 5 set velocity.x to zero

This approach will probably work for most usecases

The priority of the cases are as followed:
5 2 5
3 C 4
5 1 5

New collision algorithm
8 points again
But this time we have two cases: bottom collision, horizontal collision.
Why not only vertical and horizontal, well because we want to know when we are on the ground and when not.
But why do you want to know that? Well that is easier for the animation controller to figure out which animation to run.

Definitions:
    The desired position of a sprite is the position after resolving the gravity, velocity, accelarition, friction, clamping etc.
    A "ground" tile is a tile that is defined in your tile map as a ground.

The algorithm:
    - Retrieve the 8 points surrounding the sprite in his desired position
    - For each point, retrieve the "ground" tile in which it resides
    - Define collision as: if a point is in a ground tile, it is a collision
    - Define the 8 points as: B bottom, T top, L left, R right, TL top left, TR top right etc.
    - If B has collision: onGround is true
    - If B or T collide: resolve vertical collision on of them
    - If L or R collide: resolve horizontal collision on of them
    - For(_point in {TL, TR, BL, BR})
        if _point collides then
            if the vertical distance of the _point and the center _point of the tile is larger than the horizontal distance then:
                resolve vertical collision
            else
                resolve horizontal collision
            end if
            break
        end if
    end for

    Resolving horizontal collision:
        if the tile is left of the desired position then
            desiredPosition.x = tilePosition.x + spriteWidth + 1
        else 
            desiredPosition.x = tilePosition.x - spriteWidth - 1
        end if

    Resolving vertical collision:
        if the tile is above the desired position then
            desiredPosition.y = tilePosition.y + spriteHeight + 1
        else
            desiredPosition.y = tilePosition.y - spriteHeight - 1
        end if
        set y velocity to 0
end algorithm

So for the tile position and the player position it is necessary to use the center point, otherwise this algorithm will fail.
Why the +/- 1 for calculating the correct desired position. That ensures that the sprite is barerly not colliding with the sprite.

I suck at math.
The correct algorithms for resolving horizontal/vertical collision is this:
    Resolving horizontal collision:
        if the tile is left of the desired position then
            desiredPosition.x = tilePosition.x + spriteWidth/2 + tileWidth/2
        else 
            desiredPosition.x = tilePosition.x - spriteWidth/2 - tileWidth/2
        end if

    Resolving vertical collision:
        if the tile is above the desired position then
            desiredPosition.y = tilePosition.y + spriteHeight/2 + tileHeight/2
        else
            desiredPosition.y = tilePosition.y - spriteHeight/2 - tileHeight/2
        end if
        set y velocity to 0
That bullcrap about that rounding was just plain wrong....

# Rant 4
Resolving slope collision. I already wrote this rant #4, but due wrong commiting I lost everything I wrote :(.
The algorithm for slope collision is:
    
    - If B has collision:
        - If tile is a slope: resolve slope collision
        - else resolve vertical collision
        - onGround is true
    - else if T collide: resolve vertical collision

    Resolving slope collision:
        if the slope is negative:
            define p1 as left bottom point of the tile
            define p2 as right top point of the tile
        else
            define p1 as left top oint of the tile
            define p2 as right bottom of the tile
        define a = (p1.y - p2.y) / (p1.x - p2.x);
        
        desiredPosition.y = a * desiredPosition.x + (-1 * a * p1.x) - p1.y
        
        set y velocity to 0

Now you are wondering, but what if L or R are colliding with slope. Well. They dont. The only position which can collide is bottom, the other points will act as if there is no tile there.

Problem now is, how do we know that the slope is negative or not. One way is to store it as dictionary in the tile properties. But that is expensive. Once again, I come back to maintaining an array list of tile properties.
