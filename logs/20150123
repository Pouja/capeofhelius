Day 3: 20150123

So I finally really started on the project. Today was just getting cocos2d-x to get running and compiling.
The plan now is to build the first scene, where the characters starts and can finish the game by getting to the end.

This will allow me to build the game step by step. So the first step will be correctly loading the scene.
Loading the character sprites. Making the animation. Dying and finishing.

Next step will be the extend the scene with text popups, npc interraction (vs bad and good npc's), using skills.
All that will probably take about 4 working days to get it working.
