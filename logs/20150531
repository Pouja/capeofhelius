So long time since I did a blog thingy.
Since the last time I implemented:
 * the physics for rectangle type of ground tiles.
 * the main player animatin.
 * collision detection.
 * basic event handling.
 * basic game hud.

I also finished the story.
What will happen now, is that will make the level design. Designing the five levels.
After that I have to implement a map to scene converter. That sets up the scene with all the animation.
I also have to implement the dialog system (when multiple characters are talking to each other.)
I have to implement enemy animation with death on collision.

So a lot to do.
That will be some long night, since the deadline is the birthday of Zoe which is 20 april.
That gives me 19 days, 18 nights, so around 10 working days.

We will see how it goes
