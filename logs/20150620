So today my gf has played the first chapter of the game. And it was create success. Got a lot of feedback on how to build a better game.

Things learned:
 * People need to learn to adapt to the controls, give them the ability to do that. What I did wrong was that I started a bit too difficult.
 * People like collecting stuff, give them a reward for doing so. All was this my intent when I added the coins, I just hadn't a good idea how to do to the reward.
 * Dying, so when should you lose a life and when should you gain one. The problem was that Zoe had to do all the dialogues three times because she had to start the game over three times due dying to much (you had 4 lives). This is an interesting concept where I should look how the other platform games handle this.
 * Sound, it adds another dimension to the game. But due time constraints I couldn't implement this.
 * More clear which inputs you can use and what they do. I had to explain it, but it could have been easily solved by using a blinky button.
 * More story. There were only 4 dialogues in the first chapter which didn't create much of a story. There should be things on the way (like pieces of a map or old journals (aka skyrim)) where the user learns more about the backstory.
 * THAT I LOVE MAKING GAMES. Holy shit this is really something I want to do for the rest of my life. The moment that people are smiling and interacting with something you make is just phenomenal.
