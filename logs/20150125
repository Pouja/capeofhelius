day 4: 20150125

So today I worked on setting the viewport correctly. There are probably better written functions than the one that I wrote.
But as it counts for each part, I want to learn. This seemed something that is doable in reasonable amount of time.
Of course I'm not going the reinvent every part, but only the ones that are doable.

So for the viewport there were 3 cases to consider. One that the either the x or y cord is closer than half of the viewport of each side (that are 2 cases for x and y). Third is the case that x or y are somewhere no there. It is easy solveable with if statements.

Next step: adding the character. I have really to stop myself from restructering everything now. The way everything is placed in the directories is horrible. So after I have implemented and tested some basic shit. I will refactor everything.
