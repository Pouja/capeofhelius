Redesigning the physic engine.
Currently the physics is tightly coupled to player, platfor, etc.
The idea is the split the physic from the other logic.

So how will it work.
There will be a physic engine and physic component.
Where player will have a player physic component, and platform a platform physic component etc.

In the main loop, it will call update on the physic engine.
Where the physic engine, first lets the movable physic calculate their desired position for the next tick.
Now that I am saying this, there are two types of physic components. One is the non movable when colliding(the map, the enemies (currently), platform, etc) and the players.
Not sure if I should separate them....

When all the desired positions are calculated, it will check for each movable component with each other component if there is a collision.
If there is one, it will call onCollision(component).
