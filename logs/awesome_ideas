Alternating gravity, so it will be up and down. With a fixed timer, so every 2s it will go up for 5s and then down.
Also when you land after taking a huge jump the camera will shake and you will have dust spreading.

Idea is also to introduce a game concept (like alternating gravity) and in the final fight have them all togheter

after lvl 3 you will get the no game no life epi 8 style. So an outra and then statics, and eventually it will scatter and show the world being destroyed. Where the white witch will yell EDO TENSAI and everything will float and form huge balls where you walk on.:wq
