# The heroine: zoe
So like every story, this one also has a main character: zoe. A strong, but yet a young woman set to be in an adventure she never expected. Her back story is like every other girl you meet. She cries, she learns, she gets angry, she smiles and foremost she always keeps her head up, an ability she will need dearly.

# The villain
The white witch Samantiane (with an e, because why not), a girl twisted in her own emotions, blind to ones of others. She has led a tragic live which has turned this girl in the villain of this story. Blessed, or cursed, by the findings she made in deep hole of Helius she has turned in the white witch of Helius. A power to be used in love, but when one does not recognize that in other, it becomes a curse.

# The town
Helius, city of harbor. A small city to be said, very small indeed. As every local here knows one another, they all keep their secrets to them self. Secrets as small that one has stolen the fruit of a garden and secrets as large as the unfound Cape of Helius. A Cape so powerful that is written with a capital and when one speaks of it... he or she will speak it out loud. The Cape which lies in Helius was once brought a girl, like any other girl you meet, a girl that cries, learns, gets angry and smiles, but always keeps her head up. No one even remembers her name, so they all refer her as The One. But what the Cape does, is beyond this world and that is the only thing that anyone knows about.
