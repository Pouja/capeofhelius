Zoe: "So cold, where am I this time?"
Spirit: "In my realm again."
Spirit: "As I love to see you time to time, you do not belong here."
Spirit: "LEAVE AT ONCE!"
Zoe: "Well, you are the worst spirit ever..."
Spirit: "Please leave, it pains me to see your brown eyes."
Spirit: "Your eyes, with pitch black core, a bright sun around giving me... leave please."
Zoe: "...warmth as I stare into it."
Spirit: "It seems that a part of you never forgets, it makes me happy and sad at the same time."
Zoe: "Who are you?"
Spirit: *smiles* as he fades away.
